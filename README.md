# f1-predictions
Backend for F1 predictions contest. Built with API Gateway and Lambdas. I originally built this with RDS (MySQL) to learn more about RDS and VPC. The database has since been migrated to DynamoDB.  

## Folder Structure
Each lambda has its own top level folder. All terraform code can be found in `infrastructure/`
